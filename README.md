## Lab 6 - Hashing

This program allows you to review study material (terms and definitions) of different subjects

## Program Description

The program stores different study topics in a hash table designated for a particular subject. It 
can then run through all the stored terms and check if your answers are correct compared to the 
defintions that are stored in the table.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
* Answers have to be input exactly as the topic definition is listed
* For now if you want to add more subjects you can do so manually by adding a .txt file to the 
  Subjects folder with terms and defintions formatted with a T: and D: in front of it (no space)
* Currently no code handling the case for if you input the wrong data type
* The file paths that are used are relative so if you run the jar file in the from the command line
   make sure to navigate to the project file/directory before running
